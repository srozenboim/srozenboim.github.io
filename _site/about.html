## About

I am a former accountant turned software developer. Before deciding to become a developer, I studied Economics and Accounting at UC Santa Barbara and graduated in Spring of 2014. After working as an accountant for a year and a half, I decided that I needed to make a career change and pursue a career that is more challenging and intellectually stimulating. I love solving problems and learning new things, which are two things I really love about coding. In February 2016, I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp, a coding bootcamp in San Francisco, which focuses on web development. I'm currently looking for an entry-level job that will continue the fast-paced learning I have done since then.
